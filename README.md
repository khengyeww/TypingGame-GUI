# TypingGame-GUI
A GUI typing game made during uni 3rd year

### Desired display size for the app: 800x600 (W x H)

## Gameplay Instruction
1. First pick a video, or use the default video.
2. Start the typing game.
3. Upon typing correctly, the chosen video will play normally, else it will stop at the frame where mistype occured.
4. Clear condition: Finish the last sentence after the total video duration is exceeded.
5. After finishing, the result video will be replayed.

**PS:** The result video should be the same as shown during playing phase (play smoothly or stop at certain frame).
This is to reflect player's typing skill (video playing smoothly means player has great typing skill and vice versa).
But I failed to implement this part~

## Please Read
The game is not completed and will not be completed but the main part is still playable.

#### Unimplemented features:
1. Intended result video's playing feature (mentioned in **PS** above)
2. Score ranking feature

Playing in sizes other than mentioned above might provide bad experiences.

**PS:** The game view may look different in different OSes as well. \***Recommended: Windows***
